# hello-world
This is an example of how to create a repository in Github. For project purposes only.

Konnichiwa Earthlings,

I'm Erwin, a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student. 
If you are wondering why is this, I'm just trying this feature of github/git called branching.
It is for academic purpose only for now but in the future I hope I can work in a developer team and we can utilize this tool/platform.
